# SWARM-OPTIMIZED-SENTIMENT-DETECTION

This project focuses on sentiment detection enhanced with swarm optimization techniques. The main objective is to improve the accuracy and efficiency of sentiment analysis by leveraging swarm intelligence for better feature selection and optimization. The system classifies text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments and can be applied to domains such as social media analysis, customer feedback, and opinion mining.
# Sentiment detection using machine learning models.
# Swarm optimization techniques for improving feature selection.
# Higher accuracy compared to traditional approaches.
# Scalable for real-world applications like reviews, surveys, and social platforms.

# Project Motivation
The project began as part of our college coursework to explore how optimization techniques can enhance machine learning tasks. Over time, it grew into a practical approach to tackling sentiment analysis challenges.
Traditional deep learning models are powerful but require a lot of computation, take long to train, and struggle with ambiguous or noisy language. 
To overcome this, the project explores combining Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Swarm Intelligence (SI) algorithms, which are inspired by collective behaviour in nature and are more adaptive and efficient. 

# Objectives
To explore the integration of Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Swarm Intelligence (SI) for analysing human emotions, opinions, and mental states from text-based data (sentiment analysis).
To design and implement models using Swarm Intelligence algorithms such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) for optimizing sentiment analysis tasks and compare them.
To conduct a comparative study of NLP + Deep Learning, NLP + Swarm Intelligence, and NLP + Deep Learning + Swarm Intelligence approaches in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability.
